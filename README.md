This is a work in proress... the case hasn't been tested with an actual physical 3A+, as my shippment hasn't arrived yet.

## Summary

Simple cases for a [Raspberry Pi 3 Model A+](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-a-plus/).

The VESA cases allow for mounting to the back of a monitor using M4 screws.

Geometry created from the [published mechanical drawing](https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2018/11/Raspberry_Pi_3A_mechanical-drawing.pdf), and caliper measurements from a 3 B+ (since the 3 A+ part hadn't shipped at the time - Nov 16, 2018).

This part is useful to gauge fitment for a case.  dimensions are +/- 0.05 mm

## Print Settings

Dimensions are in millimeters.

## Post-Printing

Clean off any raft or supports with a knife.
Use a hand-drill to even out the holes with appropriately sized drill bits.
